# Small and Well-named

Build a habit of decomposing.

While breaking down a large problem into smaller parts,
we often need need to name the parts.
Naming helps in recollection and understanding.
The 'parts' could manifest as functions, files, classes, and so on.

These exercises are about cutting into smaller parts and naming them.
Consider:

- Can we read out the decomposition from the file-names?
- Can the name of each function or class tell us its contribution?
- Can the name of each variable or constant convey its purpose?
- Can it simplify the code? How low can you bring the Cyclomatic Complexity?
- Can this 'naming exercise' uncover hidden needs?
